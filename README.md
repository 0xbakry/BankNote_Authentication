# BankNote_Authentication
To detect fake bank notes using Decision Tree, through four features: Variance, Skewness, Curtosis, and Entropy.                                                            
#Experiment1:

Useing 25% of the samples for training and the rest for testing:                                                                                                            
1- Rerun this experiment five times and notice the impact of different random splits of the data into training and test sets.                                               
2- Report the sizes and accuracies of these trees in each experiment.                                                                                                       

#Experiment2:                                                                                                                                                           

with a range from [30% - 70%] of train_test split ratio Measure the impact of
training set size on the accuracy and the size of the learned tree:                                                                                                        
1- run the experiment with five different random seeds.                                                                                                                     
2- calculate mean, maximum and minimum accuracy at each training set_size.                                                                                                  
3- measure the mean, max and min tree size.                                                                                                                                 
4- store your statistics in a report.                                                                                                                                           
5- Draw two plots:                                                                                                                                                          
1) shows accuracy against training set size.

2) the number of nodes in the final tree against training set size.
