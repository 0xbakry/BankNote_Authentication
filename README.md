# BankNote_Authentication
To detect fake Banknotes using Decision Tree, through four features: Variance, Skewness, Curtosis, and Entropy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
# Experiment1:

Using 25% of the samples for training and the rest for testing:                                                                                                            
1- Rerun this experiment five times and notice the impact of different random splits of the data into training and test sets.                                               
2- Report the sizes and accuracies of these trees in each experiment.     

# Experiment2:                                                                                                                                                           

Measure the impact of training set size on the accuracy and the size of the learned tree.
==> The training set sizes in the range [ 30% - 70%]                                                                                                        
1- Run the experiment with five different random seeds.                                                                                                                     
2- Calculate mean, maximum and minimum accuracy at each training set_size.                                                                                                  
3- Measure the mean, max and min tree size.                                                                                                                                 
4- Store your statistics in a report ==> You can find a sample in "Report.csv" file.                                                                                                                                           
5- Draw two plots:                                                                                                                                                          
1) Shows accuracy against training set size.

2) The number of nodes in the final tree against training set size.
